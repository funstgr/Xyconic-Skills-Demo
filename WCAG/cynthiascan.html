<ul>
<div class="tooltip">The intent of this Success Criterion is to make information conveyed by non-text content accessible through the use of a text alternative. Text alternatives are a primary way for making information accessible because they can be rendered through any sensory modality (for example, visual, auditory or tactile) to match the needs of the user. Providing text alternatives allows the information to be rendered in a variety of ways by a variety of user agents. For example, a person who cannot see a picture can have the text alternative read aloud using synthesized speech. A person who cannot hear an audio file can have the text alternative displayed so that he or she can read it. In the future, text alternatives will also allow information to be more easily translated into sign language or into a simpler form of the same language.</div><li>	<img src="images/iconVisual.png" height="15" alt="Visual check" /><a target="_new" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/F3.html">F3</a> Failure of Success Criterion 1.1.1 due to using CSS to include images that co...

<div class="tooltip">The CSS background-image property provides a way to include images in the document with CSS without any reference in the HTML code. The CSS background-image property was designed for decorative purposes and it is not possible to associate text alternatives with images that are included via CSS.

<div class="tooltip">This describes a failure condition for all techniques involving text alternatives. If the text in the "text alternative" cannot be used in place of the non-text content without losing information or function then it fails because it is not, in fact, an alternative to the non-text content.

 the scope of any cell used as a header. The scope identifies whether the cell is a
 header for a row, column, or group of rows or columns. The values <code>row</code>,

<ul>
<div class="tooltip">The objective of this technique is to group items in a selection list. A selection list is a set of allowed values for a form control such as a multi-select list or a combo box. Often, selection lists have groups of related options. Those groups should be semantically identified, rather than simply delimiting the groups with "dummy" list entries. This allows user agents to collapse the options by group to support quicker skimming of the options, and to indicate in what group an option of interest is located. It also helps to visually break up long lists so that users can more easily locate the option(s) they are interested in.</div><li>	<img src="images/iconNA.png" height="15" alt="N/A" />Page has no SELECT elements

<ul>
<div class="tooltip">The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that all users can access instructions for using the content, even when they cannot perceive shape or size or use information about spatial location or orientation. 
 Some content relies on knowledge of the shape or position of objects that are not available from the structure of the content (for example, "round button" or "button to the right"). 
 Some users with disabilities are not able to perceive shape or position due to the nature of the assistive technologies they use.

<div class="tooltip">The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that all users can access information that is conveyed by color differences, that is, by the use of color where each color has a meaning assigned to it. If the information is conveyed through color differences in an image (or other non-text format), the color may not be seen by users with color deficiencies. In this case, providing the information conveyed with color through another visual means ensures users who cannot see color can still perceive the information.</div><li>	<img src="images/iconVisual.png" height="15" alt="Visual check" /><a target="_new" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G14">G14</a> Ensure that information conveyed by color differences is also available in text

<ul>
<div class="tooltip">The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that users with disabilities are given adequate time to interact with Web content whenever possible. People with disabilities such as blindness, <span>low vision,</span> dexterity impairments, and cognitive limitations may require more time to read content or to perform functions such as filling out on-line forms. If Web functions are time-dependent, it will be difficult for some users to perform the required action before a time limit occurs. This may render the service inaccessible to them. Designing functions that are not time-dependent will help people with disabilities succeed at completing these functions. Providing options to disable time limits, customize the length of time limits, or request more time before a time limit occurs helps those users who require more time than expected to successfully complete tasks. These options are listed in the order that will be most helpful for the user. Disabling time limits is better than customizing the length of time limits, which is better than requesting more time before a time limit occurs.</div><li>	<img src="images/iconVisual.png" height="15" alt="Visual check" /><a target="_new" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/SCR1.html">SCR1</a> Allow the user to extend the default time limit

<ul>
<div class="tooltip">The intent of this Success Criterion is to help users find content and orient themselves within it by ensuring that each Web page has a deive title. Titles identify the current location without requiring users to read or interpret page content. When titles appear in site maps or lists of search results, users can more quickly identify the content they need. User agents make the title of the page easily available to the user for identifying the page. For instance, a user agent may display the page title in the window title bar or as the name of the tab containing the page.</div><li>	<img src="images/iconVisual.png" height="15" alt="Visual check" /><a target="_new" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/H25.html">H25</a> Pages are required to use the TITLE element

<ul>
<div class="tooltip">The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that when users navigate sequentially through content, they encounter information in an order that is consistent with the meaning of the content and can be operated from the keyboard. This reduces confusion by letting users form a consistent mental model of the content. There may be different orders that reflect logical relationships in the content. For example, move through components in a table one row at a time or one column at a time both reflect the logical relationships in the content. Either order may satisfy this Success Criterion.</div><li>	<img src="images/iconVisual.png" height="15" alt="Visual check" /><a target="_new" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/H4.html">H4</a> Create a logical tab order through links, form controls, and objects

<ul>
<div class="tooltip">The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that users are aware that an error has occurred and can determine what is wrong. The error message should be as specific as possible. 
 In the case of an unsuccessful form submission, re-displaying the form and indicating the fields in error is insufficient for some users to perceive that an error has occurred. Screen reader users, for example, will not know there was an error until they encounter one of the indicators. They may abandon the form altogether before encountering the error indicator, thinking that the page simply is not functional.</div><li>	<img src="images/iconVisual.png" height="15" alt="Visual check" /><a target="_new" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/SCR18.html">SCR18</a> Provide client-side validation and alert

When users fail to provide input for any mandatory form fields, information is provided in text to enable the users to identify which fields were omitted. One approach is to use client-side validation and provide an  dialog box identifying the mandatory fields which were omitted. Another approach, using server-side validation, is to re-display the form (including any previously entered data), with either a text deion at the location of the omitted mandatory field, or a text deion that identifies the omitted mandatory fields.</div><li>	<img src="images/iconNA.png" height="15" alt="N/A" />No forms on page

<div class="tooltip">The intent of this Success Criterion is to help users avoid making mistakes when their input is required. To help avoid mistakes it is good user interface design to provide simple instructions and cues for entering information. Some users with disabilities may be more likely to make mistakes than users without disabilities or recovery from mistakes may be more difficult, making mistake avoidance an important strategy for users with disabilities. People with disabilities rely on well documented forms and procedures to interact with a page. Blind users need to know exactly what information should be entered into form fields and what the available choices are.

<ul>
<div class="tooltip">The intent of this Success Criterion is to provide enough contrast between text and its background so that it can be read by people with moderately low vision (who do not use contrast-enhancing assistive technology). For people without color deficiencies, hue and saturation have minimal or no effect on legibility as assessed by reading performance (Knoblauch et al., 1991). Color deficiencies can affect luminance contrast somewhat. Therefore, in the recommendation, the contrast is calculated in such a way that color is not a key factor so that people who have a color vision deficit will also have adequate contrast between the text and the background.</div><li>	<img src="images/iconVisual.png" height="15" alt="Visual check" /><a target="_new" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G145.html">G145</a> Ensure that a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 exists between text (and images ...

<ul>
<div class="tooltip">The objective of this technique is to make sure that users can read text that is presented over a background. For Success Criterion 1.4.3, this technique describes the minimum contrast ratio for text that is less than 18 point (if not bold) and less than 14 point (if bold). For Success Criterion 1.4.5, this technique relaxes the 7:1 contrast ratio requirement for text that is at least 18 point (if not bold) or at least 14 point (if bold).

If the background is a solid color (or all black or all white) then the relative luminance of the text can be maintained by making sure that each of the text letters have 4.5:1 contrast ratio with the background. 

If the background or the letters vary in relative luminance (or are patterned) then the background around the letters can be chosen or shaded so that the letters maintain a 4.5:1 contrast ratio with the background behind them even if they do not have that contrast ratio with the entire background. 

The contrast ratio can sometimes be maintained by changing the relative luminance of the letters as the relative luminance of the background changes across the page. 

Another method is to provide a halo around the text that provides the necessary contrast ratio if the background image or color would not normally be sufficiently different in relative luminance.

<ul>
<div class="tooltip">Users with vision loss or cognitive challenges often require specific foreground (text) and background color combinations. For instance, many people with low vision find it much easier to see a Web page that has white text on a black background, so they may have set their user agent to create this contrast. If the author specifies that the text must be black, then it may override the settings of the user agent and render a page that has black text (specified by the author) on black background (that was set in the user agent). This principle also works in reverse. If the Webmaster forces the background to be white, then the white background specified by the author would be the same color as the white text (which was set in the user agent) rendering the page unusable to the user. Therefore, if the author specifies a foreground (text) color then they should also specify a background color which has sufficient contrast (link) with the foreground and vice versa.</div><li>	<img src="images/iconPass.png" height="15" alt="Passed" />Page contain no elements that specific foreground color but no background color or vice versa

<div class="tooltip">The objective of this technique is to demonstrate how CSS can be used to replace structured HTML text with images of text in a way that makes it possible for users to view content according to their preferences. To use this technique, an author starts by creating an HTML page that uses semantic elements to mark up the structure of the page. The author then designs two or more stylesheets for that page. One stylesheet presents the HTML text as text and the second uses CSS features to replace some of the HTML text with images of text. Finally, through the use of server-side or client-side ing, the author provides a control that allows the user to switch between the available views. </div><li>	<img src="images/iconVisual.png" height="15" alt="Visual check" />Verify that if background information conveys information it supplies a text alternative

<div class="tooltip">The objective of this technique is to ensure that the focused component can be visually identified by the user by relying on user agent support. It is common for user agents to highlight standard controls in some way when they receive focus.

<ul>
<div class="tooltip">The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure consistent identification of functional components that appear repeatedly within a set of Web pages. A strategy that people who use screen readers use when operating a Web site is to rely heavily on their familiarity with functions that may appear on different Web pages. If identical functions have different labels on different Web pages, the site will be considerably more difficult to use. It may also be confusing and increase the cognitive load for people with cognitive limitations.

<ul>
<div class="tooltip">The purpose of this technique is to help for users with cognitive disabilities, blindness and vision loss to understand what will happen when they interact with a function on a Web page. If there are different labels on user interface components (i.e., elements, links, JavaScript objects, etc.) that have the same function, the user will not know that they have encountered a component with the same function and will not know what to expect. This could lead to many unnecessary errors.

<ul>
<div class="tooltip">The intent of this Success Criterion is to help users with disabilities avoid serious consequences as the result of a mistake when performing an action that cannot be reversed. For example, purchasing non-refundable airline tickets or submitting an order to purchase stock in a brokerage account are financial transactions with serious consequences. If a user has made a mistake on the date of air travel, he or she could end up with a ticket for the wrong day that cannot be exchanged. If the user made a mistake on the number of stock shares to be purchased, he or she could end up purchasing more stock than intended. Both of these types of mistakes involve transactions that take place immediately and cannot be altered afterwards, and can be very costly. Likewise, it may be an unrecoverable error if users unintentionally modify or delete data stored in a database that they later need to access, such as their travel profile in a travel services Web site. Test data is included in this provision because, in order for tests to be valid, users are not allowed to modify their answers once submitted; so users need to be able to ensure that their submission is correct.</div><li>	<img src="images/iconVisual.png" height="15" alt="Visual check" /><a target="_new" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/SCR18.html">SCR18</a> Provide client-side validation and alert

<div class="tooltip">The objective of this technique is to all additional audio deion to be
 inserted into a synchronized media presentation when there is not enough time in the
 gaps int the dialog. This is done by simply freezing the image so that
 additional audio deion of the video can be played. When the
 deion is finished, the synchronized media continues.</div><li>	<img src="images/iconNA.png" height="15" alt="N/A" />Page does not contain video

<ul>
<div class="tooltip">The intent of this Success Criterion is to make it possible for users to locate content in a manner that best meets their needs. Users may find one technique easier or more comprehensible to use than another.</div><li>	<img src="images/iconNA.png" height="15" alt="N/A" /><a target="_new" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/H59.html">H59</a> Use the link element and navigation tools
<ul>
<div class="tooltip">The objective of this technique is to describe how the <code>link</code> element can provide metadata about the position of an HTML page within a set of Web pages or can assist in locating content with a set of Web pages. The value of the <code>rel</code> attributes indicates what type of relation is being described, and the <code>href</code> attribute provides a link to the document having that relation. Multiple <code>link</code> elements can provide multiple relationships. Several values of <code>rel</code> are useful:</div><li>	<img src="images/iconNA.png" height="15" alt="N/A" />Link is not used for document navigation

<ul>
<div class="tooltip">The intent of this Success Criterion is to encourage the use of consistent presentation and layout for users who interact with repeated content within 
 a set of Web pages and need to locate specific information or functionality more than once.
 Individuals with low vision who use screen magnification to display a small portion of the screen at a time often use visual cues and page boundaries to quickly locate repeated content.
 Presenting repeated content in the same order is also important for visual users who use spatial memory or visual cues within the design to locate repeated content.</div><li>	<img src="images/iconNA.png" height="15" alt="N/A" /><a target="_new" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/F66">F66</a> Failure of Success Criterion 3.2.3 due to presenting navigation links in a di...
<ul>
<div class="tooltip">This describes a failure condition for all techniques involving navigation mechanisms that are repeated on multiple Web pages within a set of Web pages (Success Criterion 3.2.3). If the mechanism presents the order of links in a different order on two or more pages, then the failure is triggered.</div><li>	<img src="images/iconNA.png" height="15" alt="N/A" />Page contains no site navigation mechanisms.
